Fbx files
======================
Fbx files will be provided separately as I don't think it can be included with the Unreal Marketplace asset.

It is recommended to use the original fbx files if you want to modify the mesh and reimport into Unreal Engine because fbx exported out of UE has mesh sections joined together, and there's also the problem of missing shape keys (blendshapes) if you try to import it into Blender.

Unfortunately, there's no automated way for me to provide you the files. Please send me an email (together with the purchase receipt or alternatively post a question asking for fbx files at the Questions section) and I will provide you with the link to the shared Google Drive's Folder (which is restricted to added peoples).

You can post Questions at Unreal Marketplace or send me an email: miicaneo@gmail.com and I will try to reply you as soon as I can.

I also created a Discord Server as another option:

The Discord setup is very simple for now as I don't have much experience with Discord.
